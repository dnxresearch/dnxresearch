DNX Research is based in the Ozark Mountains with the mission to research and develop products that benefit as many people as possible.

DNX has been focused on the development of new compounds and technologies that aid in creating new solutions for mental illness. Mental illness has a long history with DNX, and we work everyday to find new solutions to this age old problem. We hope with your help this will be possible.

Our sights are not limited to mental illeess, as we are in the process of designing, testing, and developing new forms of agricultural growth systems to grow and curate faster growing, better tasting, and healthier foods. We like to think of it as "3D Printing" for agriculture. 

There are over 15 million families in the US alone that are food insecure at any time - and this number is rising, we believe that there must be a way to grow and protect our crops by creating a better food distribution system and growth environment.

#### The world deserves better.

We hope that in time we will be able to produce better products, better ideas, and better processes to creating a better world.
