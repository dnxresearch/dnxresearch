> This product line has been suspended due to current FDA regulations. While this is a legal grey area, and the FDA has not started heavy-handed regulation actions - we want to protect our consumers and stay within bounds required by law. Thank you, if you are interested in licensing or have any thoughts please contact us. 

CBD+Energy products combine the effects of anhydrous caffeine, l-theanine, and hemp-derived cannabidiol to help produce a more 'natural' energy effect without anxiety, pain, jitters, or crash.

We are expecting launch to be in January 2019, currently we are finishing up our final round of market trials. If you are interested in joining the trials please email cbd@dnxresearch.com.
