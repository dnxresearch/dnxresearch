After several years of developing products for myself I have decided to start this new venture. 

DNX Research was mostly born out of curiousity. Curiousity of what is possible, and what should be impossible. Our beginnings are simple - the idea that products should be made for consumers that are better, more afforable, and have never been created before. 

There are hundreds of ideas that have been written down, dozens tested, and more than a few that have failed - but the ones who have succeeded have become a daily tool for myself and I believe that these ideas should be made public. 

Over the course of the next year we will be releasing these ideas into the market, and we hope you all enjoy them.

Thank you, <br>
