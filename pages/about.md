We are developing new technologies that enable humans to accomplish extraordinary things on earth, and beyond. 

Our primary research is focused on designing, testing, and developing new forms of agricultural growth systems to grow and curate faster growing, better tasting, and healthier foods using our new patent-pending electromagnetic nutrient delivery system. We prefer to think of it as "3D Printing" for agriculture. 

We develop products in several different industries and uses, our motto is "Innovation From The Future", because we look to the future and in that future we see a society that is better than the one that we have. 

Founded, funded, and lead by our CEO and Director, T. Macleod Sawyer in late-2017, we have worked steadfast to create things that are better than what was and is currently possible. 

DNX Research is based out of the Ozark Mountains with the mission to research, develop, and manufacture products and services that benefit as many people as possible. We are privately funded, but always open to investment opportunities, and we have a <a href="/shop">shop</a> that helps keep our operations alive.
