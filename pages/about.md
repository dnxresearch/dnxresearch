**We develop new technologies that enable humans to accomplish extraordinary things on earth, and beyond.**

We were founded in 2017 by t. Macleod Sawyer, we have worked steadfast to think bigger and better than what should be possible. The status quo is never our objective.

A few of our priorities include: rapid agricultural growth, embedded analytical hardware sensors, and experimental propulsion systems.

DNX Research is based out of the Ozark Mountains with the mission to research, develop, and manufacture products and services that benefit as many people as possible. We are privately funded, but always open to investment opportunities, please get in contact with <a href="mailto:team@dnxresearch.com">team@dnxresearch.com</a> for more information.
