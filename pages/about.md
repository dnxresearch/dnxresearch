DNX Research is based out of the Ozark Mountains with the mission to research and develop products that benefit as many
people as possible.

We are in the process of designing, testing, and developing new forms of agricultural growth systems to grow and curate
faster growing, better tasting, and healthier foods. We like to think of it as "3D Printing" for agriculture.

Not only this, but we develop new products, inventions, and services with the mission to make life easier and more sustainable. Our motto is "The Future Is Our Innovation", because we look to the future and in that future we see a society that is better than the one that we have. 

We are privately funded, but always open to investment opportunities, and we have a <a href="/shop">shop</a> that helps keep our operations alive.
